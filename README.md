## proactive maintenance for individual systems of automobile  by using ML 

## Objective

To predict the present condition(failure/running) of the system(engine,bracking,coolant,electrical,safety) of the automobile which are equipped with sensors


### Built With

This section should list any major modules/libraries used to build the project which are mentioned below

* Python
* pandas
* numpy
* seaborn
* scipystats
* sklearn
* imblearn
* flask
* Gitlabee


## Getting Started

the dataset is taken from open source which was related to the diesel vehicle efficiency testing in real race track, the data from sensors are recorded and stored is loaded into our local jnb

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9.8

### Installation

## Usage
* gave input to the interface which was related to cooling,engine,bracking
* behind the process of prediction ml model runs behind it and the results are obtained at the interface which are synchronized with flask pickle
* the display of interface show case the results of "0"-failure,"1"- good to run
